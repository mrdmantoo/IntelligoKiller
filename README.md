This probably doesn't concern you, but if it does, please note that this is, like, pre-alpha! I have no idea if it will work and whether it works or not, I will likely not be coming back to refine this system. I will probably add a couple more files including the chrome extension needed to operate this thing, and then development will almost definitely close forever. So again, if it works, yay! If it doesn't, that's too bad. but either way, I'm probably not coming back to develop this project any more.
